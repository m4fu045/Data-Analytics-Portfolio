# Validation Framework

## Overview
Multi-stage validation approach ensuring classification accuracy and business alignment.

## Validation Stages

### Stage 1: Data Quality Validation
**Objective**: Ensure input data accuracy and completeness

**Checks**:
- Data completeness (>95% required fields)
- Value range validation (scores 1-3, spend >0)
- Outlier detection (spend >3 standard deviations)
- Missing value treatment protocols

**Criteria**: Pass if <5% data quality issues identified

### Stage 2: Algorithm Validation  
**Objective**: Verify mathematical model accuracy

**Tests**:
- **Unit Testing**: Individual component calculations
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end score calculation
- **Edge Case Testing**: Extreme values and boundary conditions
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Weight variation impact assessment

**Criteria**: All test cases pass, sensitivity <10% for minor weight changes

### Stage 3: Business Logic Validation
**Objective**: Confirm results align with business expectations

**Reviews**:
- **Cross-functional Review**: Procurement, operations, and engineering teams
- **Sample Validation**: Manual review of 50+ supplier classifications
- **Known Supplier Check**: Validate against pre-identified strategic suppliers
- **Benchmark Comparison**: Compare with industry standards

**Criteria**: >90% agreement between algorithm results and expert judgment

### Stage 4: Distribution Validation
**Objective**: Ensure balanced and actionable segmentation

**Metrics**:
- **Target Distribution**: Strategic 5%, Critical 15%, Operational 40%, Transactional 40%
- **Actual vs Target**: Within Â±5% variance acceptable
- **Business Unit Balance**: No unit with >80% in single category
- **Score Distribution**: Normal distribution around median

**Criteria**: Distribution metrics within acceptable variance

## Ongoing Monitoring

### Monthly Checks
- Classification stability (>95% suppliers unchanged)
- New supplier integration accuracy
- Data quality maintenance

### Quarterly Reviews  
- Stakeholder feedback collection
- Performance metric assessment
- Minor calibration adjustments

### Annual Validation
- Complete methodology review
- Weight optimization assessment  
- Business alignment validation
- External benchmark comparison

## Quality Assurance Metrics

### Accuracy Metrics
- **Classification Accuracy**: % correct vs expert judgment
- **Score Consistency**: Standard deviation within categories
- **Prediction Stability**: Month-over-month classification changes

### Business Impact Metrics
- **Resource Allocation Efficiency**: Strategic supplier management time
- **Risk Reduction**: Supply disruption incidents
- **Cost Optimization**: Procurement efficiency improvements
