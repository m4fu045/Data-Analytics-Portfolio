# Weight Optimization Framework

## Approach
Business unit-specific weight customization based on operational priorities and strategic focus areas.

## Weight Configuration by Business Unit

### Business Unit A (Manufacturing Focus)
```
Part Source Type:    30% - High dependency on supplier continuity
Time to Ramp:        25% - Critical for production planning
Partnership:         25% - Long-term relationship emphasis
Spend:              10% - Volume less critical than dependency
Innovation:          5% - Moderate innovation requirements
Supply Risk:         5% - Lower risk tolerance acceptable
```

### Business Unit B (Technology Focus)  
```
Supply Risk:        20% - Higher risk sensitivity required
Time to Ramp:       20% - Rapid scaling capabilities needed
Partnership:        25% - Collaborative relationships essential
Part Source Type:   15% - More supplier alternatives available
Innovation:         10% - Higher innovation requirements
Spend:             10% - Balanced spend considerations
```

## Optimization Principles

### 1. Business Context Alignment
- **Manufacturing Units**: Emphasize continuity and dependency
- **Technology Units**: Focus on innovation and risk management
- **Hybrid Units**: Balanced approach across all factors

### 2. Weight Sum Validation
- All weights sum to 100% per business unit
- Minimum 5% weight for any active criterion
- Maximum 30% weight to prevent single-factor dominance

### 3. Stakeholder Input Integration
- **Procurement Teams**: Spend and partnership emphasis
- **Operations Teams**: Ramp time and supply risk focus
- **Engineering Teams**: Innovation and technical capability priority

## Customization Process

### Step 1: Business Unit Analysis
- Review operational priorities
- Identify critical success factors
- Assess market dynamics

### Step 2: Stakeholder Workshops
- Collect input from key functions
- Validate weight assumptions
- Build consensus on priorities

### Step 3: Calibration Testing
- Test weights with sample suppliers
- Validate results against business expectations
- Adjust weights based on outcomes

### Step 4: Implementation
- Deploy customized weights
- Monitor classification results
- Establish review cycles for updates

## Review Frequency
- **Quarterly**: Minor adjustments based on performance
- **Annually**: Major review aligned with business strategy
- **Ad-hoc**: Triggered by significant business changes
