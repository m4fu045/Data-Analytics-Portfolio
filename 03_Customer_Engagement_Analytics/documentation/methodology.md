# Methodology - Customer Engagement Analytics

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Framework

### Data Collection
- **Sources:** CRM, Email platform, Event system, Social media, Website analytics
- **Integration:** ETL pipeline combining real-time and batch processing
- **Volume:** 18,000+ physician profiles, 50K+ monthly interactions

### Data Processing
- **Cleaning:** Deduplication, standardization, validation
- **Feature Engineering:** Recency, frequency, depth, diversity metrics
- **Quality Control:** 95% completeness threshold, automated validation rules

## ðŸŽ¯ Engagement Scoring Algorithm

### Core Formula
```
Engagement Score = 0.3Ã—Recency + 0.25Ã—Frequency + 0.25Ã—Depth + 0.2Ã—Diversity
```

### Components
- **Recency:** Days since last interaction (time decay function)
- **Frequency:** Interaction count normalized by peer group
- **Depth:** Quality metrics (time spent, actions taken)
- **Diversity:** Number of channels used

### Channel Weights
- Events: 2.0 (highest intent)
- Webinars: 1.5
- Website: 1.2
- Email: 1.0 (baseline)
- Social Media: 0.8

## ðŸŽ¯ Segmentation Logic

### Three-Tier Classification
```python
if engagement_score >= 0.7 and consistent_activity:
    return "Watch_List"     # High-value, maintain engagement
elif engagement_score < 0.3 or declining_trend:
    return "Alert"          # Needs intervention
else:
    return "Potential"      # Growth opportunity
```

### Alert Triggers
- 30% score decrease in 30 days
- No activity for 45+ days
- Unsubscribe/complaint events
- 50% reduction in active channels

## ðŸ“ˆ Analysis Methods

### Statistical Analysis
- **Correlation Analysis:** Engagement factors vs conversion
